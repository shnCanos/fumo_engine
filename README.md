# fourth_space_mining
- create a build/ directory in the main folder
- make an assets/ directory 
- run "start_project.sh" from the root directory 'bash start_project.sh'

regarding dependencies:
- raylib, libassert (and C++20)
- i think you dont need anything besides a c++ compiler to get this code working (hopefully)
